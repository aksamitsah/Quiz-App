- Design and implement a simple app that displays information about a small business.
## Learning outcomes:
- Understand about Layout and structure.
- Using if/else condition and user input/output.
- Identify and apprecite the difference between different view types.
- Perform simple manipulations on the Views.
- Basic app troubleshooting.

## Meets Specifications Requied to complete the project

### Layout:

- App contains 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.

- Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
- Checkboxes are only used for questions with multiple right answers. Radio buttons are only used for questions with a single right answer.
- App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.
- The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
  - Text sizes are defined in sp
  - Lengths are defined in dp
  - Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
  - The app includes at least four of the following Views: TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText, LinearLayout, 
  - RelativeLayout, ScrollView, RadioButton, RadioGroup.
- If applicable, the app uses nested ViewGroups to reduce the complexity of the layout.
- The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated. Either by updating the layout, adding a scrollable feature or some other mechanism that adheres to Android development guidelines.

### Functionality
- The code runs without errors.
- Each question has a correct answer.
- Any question which uses radio buttons allows only one to be checked at once.
- The app contains at least one if/else statement
- The grading button displays a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz.
- The grading logic checks each answer correctly. The app accurately calculates the number of correct answers and does not include incorrect answers in the count.

### Note: When applicable, in the grading logic remember to check that the correct answers are checked AND the incorrect answers are not checked.

### Code Readability
- All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.

- The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
- The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
